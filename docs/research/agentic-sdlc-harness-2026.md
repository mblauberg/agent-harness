# Agentic delivery harness: 2026 research synthesis

Status: Research baseline
Evidence cut-off: 10 July 2026
Review cadence: quarterly, and whenever a primary model, provider interface or
material security standard changes

## Executive finding

The harness already implements the strongest common pattern across current
guidance: humans set intent and consequential gates; agents execute inside an
authority envelope; deterministic checks and independent review precede human
acceptance; production evidence returns to the next cycle. Its software path is
materially stronger than its paths for research, documents and other
evidence-bearing work.

The next design should not add another monolithic workflow. It should introduce
one domain-neutral delivery kernel with profiles, safeguards, typed evidence
and machine-checkable receipts. Software remains one profile. Research,
analysis, document and agent-product profiles substitute their own artifacts,
graders and release semantics; high-stakes safeguards compose across them
without weakening shared authority, review and improvement contracts.

The other major gap is proof that the harness itself improves. `retrospect`
describes the right flywheel, but comparable baselines, recurrence and promoted
changes are not yet machine-checkable. Skill telemetry also needs an explicit
privacy boundary: private transcripts must not become the default analytics
database for a public, cross-project harness.

## Research boundary and method

This report combines:

- a live structural audit of the repository's 30 global skills, runtime
  constitution, routing, run receipts, installers and tests;
- the supplied Google/Kaggle May 2026 whitepaper, checked from the local PDF;
- current primary publications from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS, Microsoft,
  GitHub, NIST and OWASP; and
- synthesis limited to practices supported by more than one source or by a
  clear local failure mode.

The sources address two related systems. Coding-harness guidance concerns an
agent doing project work. Agent-lifecycle guidance concerns an AI agent being
built and operated as a product. This repository must support both without
confusing their gates: a delivery receipt is not a production-agent trace, and
a coding review is not an agent-behaviour evaluation.

## Convergent principles

### 1. Intent is an executable boundary

Modern guidance does not remove specifications. It changes them from detailed
implementation recipes into an outcome, rationale, constraints, risks,
acceptance measures and authority envelope. The harness should fail closed when
a consequential design has no artifact, approver or evidence digest. Status
text alone is not approval evidence.

### 2. Outcome and trajectory are separate

A correct final artifact can be produced through an unsafe or unauthorised
trajectory. Conversely, an acceptable trajectory can fail the requested
outcome. Every profile therefore needs both:

- outcome evidence: tests, source coverage, render checks, rubric scores,
  signed decisions or observed state; and
- trajectory evidence: authority, tool/model lineage, disclosure, reviewer
  independence, degradations and human gates.

### 3. Deterministic checks precede judgement

Static checks are cheaper, reproducible and easier to audit than a model
review. Model or human judgement belongs where meaning, taste or uncertain
evidence genuinely requires it. Reviewer councils should use distinct lenses
and independent first passes, then evidence-based adjudication—not voting.

### 4. Parallelism follows decomposability

The harness is right to use native subagents and the other primary family, but
the number of agents is not a quality metric. Parallel workers need independent
questions, non-overlapping writes and compressed artifact returns. Sequential
reasoning stays with one owner. Gemini, xAI and other families are useful
advisory dissenters; provider failure cannot block the primary-family gate.

### 5. Context is curated infrastructure

Durable project knowledge belongs in concise project artifacts, not provider
transcripts or private memory. Logs are evidence stores with retention rules,
not documentation. The harness should measure stale state, duplicate truth,
oversized entrypoints and orphaned scratch data, but delete only artifacts with
clear ownership and expiry.

### 6. Improvement needs controlled evidence

The flywheel is incomplete until it records a baseline, a comparable run, a
root-cause cluster, an authorised change, a regression gate and recurrence in a
later cycle. Automatic self-modification would combine diagnosis, authority and
verification in one actor. The safer design is proposal-first: humans approve
material harness changes; deterministic and held-out evals test them.

## Current-state assessment

### Strong coverage

- concise bootstrap and deeper runtime constitution;
- equal Claude/Codex primaries with one accountable chair;
- risk-proportional native and cross-family review;
- non-blocking advisory families;
- model policy separated from adapter execution, with actual lineage receipts;
- software implementation, review, release and session hygiene;
- durable work maps, resumable autonomous labs and explicit human gates; and
- public-safety and harness contract tests.

### Material gaps

1. `implement` and its run validator assume Git revisions and source paths, so
   the supposed general lifecycle has no neutral execution contract.
2. A design gate can be marked approved without binding an artifact, digest,
   decision owner, approver or required risk analysis.
3. `retrospect` has no comparable-cycle receipt or validator.
4. `skill-audit` instructs agents to scan all provider transcripts and quote
   user messages without an explicit scope, redaction or disclosure gate.
5. Observation is mostly an immediate release check, not a defined evidence
   window with thresholds, incidents and retirement criteria.
6. Security is a review lens more often than deterministic SAST, dependency,
   secret, IaC and agentic-threat evidence.
7. Existing installations are skipped rather than reconciled through a
   versioned ownership manifest.
8. Instruction precedence is not stated identically across all entrypoints.
9. Trigger fixtures cover only a minority of skills and are not a held-out,
   repeated routing evaluation.
10. Several skills exceed the intended compact body and should progressively
    disclose reference material.

## Adopt, adapt, reject

Adopt typed intent, mixed graders, outcome/trajectory evidence, persistent
receipts, deterministic security validation, production-to-eval feedback and
periodic garbage collection.

Adapt enterprise fleet concepts to a personal global harness: use lightweight
local manifests and receipts, not a mandatory cloud control plane. Apply
repeated trials only to stochastic behaviour; deterministic scripts need one
reproducible execution. Make privacy-preserving aggregates the default and raw
trace access an explicit exception.

Reject autonomous harness mutation, majority-vote review, always-on
multi-agent fan-out, vendor-locked lifecycle semantics, raw transcript memory,
unbounded logs and claims of universal best practice without a dated evidence
baseline.

## Research maintenance contract

Each recommendation in the implementation specification names this evidence
cut-off. A quarterly `retrospect` pass should check source availability,
superseding editions, changed provider capabilities and local counter-evidence.
A source change opens a proposal; it does not silently rewrite policy. Draft
standards such as NIST SSDF 1.2 must be labelled and rechecked on finalisation.
Model names and runtime flags remain capability-discovered data, not research
claims.
