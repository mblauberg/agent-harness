## 20. Performance and resource policy

The system is local and single-user through Stage 5. Defaults favour bounded
work; leader limits remain disabled until Stage 5:

```yaml
limits:
  maximum_tree_depth_below_chair: 2
  maximum_leaders: 4
  maximum_workers_per_leader: 5
  maximum_concurrent_provider_turns: 8
  maximum_inline_message_bytes: 4096
  maximum_message_hops: 4
  maximum_unacknowledged_messages_per_agent: 100
  reserve_for_verification_and_recovery_percent: 25
```

`maximum_leaders` is the run-wide count of all active top-level and nested team
leaders, not a per-depth allowance. The fifth leader is rejected atomically
before any authority, agent, task, group or budget row survives.

The Stage 1 core shall support at least 32 registered simulated agents. Stage 3
shall support eight concurrent provider turns on the local development machine.
Local mailbox and task operations shall complete within 100 ms at p95 under
that load, excluding provider and filesystem artifact latency.

## 21. Pinned implementation baseline

These versions are the proposed Stage 1 core baseline, verified on 10 July
2026. Review shall revalidate them before implementation begins.

| Dependency | Version |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 24.15.0 |
| TypeScript | 7.0.2 |
| `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` | 1.29.0 |
| `better-sqlite3` | 12.11.1 |
| `yaml` | 2.9.0 |
| `ajv` | 8.20.0 |
| `uuid` | 14.0.1 |
| Vitest | 4.1.10 |
The lockfile pins exact transitive dependencies. A provider stage cannot enter
implementation until `config/adapter-compatibility.yaml` records each adapter's
contract version, exact package version or source commit, protocol/schema
version and hash, supported runtime range, capability fixture version, official
source URL and verification date. Stage 3 pins Claude Agent SDK, Codex
app-server and Herdr contracts. Stage 4 pins Pi, Agy, Cursor and Kiro or ACP.
An adapter without a verified entry remains disabled.

## 22. Requirements

### 22.1 Functional requirements

- **FR-001 (Stage 2):** Claude Code and Codex shall expose the same fabric tool and
  resource semantics through their MCP clients.
- **FR-002 (Stage 2):** Separate client proxies shall communicate with one shared daemon
  and coordination store.
- **FR-003 (Stage 1):** The fabric shall persist each message before delivery and shall
  support receive, acknowledge, retry and replay by cursor.
- **FR-004 (Stage 1):** The fabric shall preserve one chair and one owner for every active
  task or stage.
- **FR-005 (Stage 1):** The fabric shall reject delegation that widens authority, expiry
  or budget.
- **FR-006 (Stage 1):** The fabric shall reject overlapping active write-scope leases.
- **FR-007 (Stage 3):** The fabric shall support headless, observed, interactive and
  hybrid visibility profiles.
- **FR-008 (Stage 3):** The paired-visible profile shall display the chair and paired
  primary side-by-side in Herdr while workers remain headless by default when
  the chair was launched under Herdr; otherwise it shall show the peer and
  record degraded chair-pane visibility.
- **FR-009 (Stage 3):** Loss of Herdr shall not lose tasks, messages, leases or provider
  resume references.
- **FR-010 (Stage 1):** Agents sharing an authorised task, dependency or discussion group
  shall be able to address each other directly.
- **FR-011 (Stage 1):** A direct message shall not transfer task ownership or authority.
- **FR-012 (Stage 3):** The fabric shall support persistent primary sessions
  and ephemeral chair-owned workers through capability-advertising adapters.
- **FR-013 (Stage 3):** Agents shall request compaction, rotation or release through a
  checkpointed lifecycle operation.
- **FR-014 (Stage 3):** The daemon shall not delete provider-native session files.
- **FR-015 (Stage 3):** Model and effort resolution shall use the existing
  trusted model router. For a task-bound answer-bearing spawn, the daemon shall
  invoke it from a strict route request at new-action admission and atomically
  retain the canonical request, receipt and both digests on the provider action
  before provider I/O; a caller-authored post-hoc receipt cannot certify the
  action.
- **FR-016 (Stage 4):** An optional bonus-family leg shall follow its configured
  retry and acknowledgement deadline, then terminate as degraded or failed and
  record the reason rather than block the required primary path.
- **FR-016A (Stage 4):** A fresh ephemeral provider worker or reviewer shall run
  through a route-bound, task-bound `provider-action.dispatch` `spawn`, commit
  its bounded answer privately and project the applicable bounded answer or
  certifying-review digest/safe result. It shall create no
  retained agent identity or implicit provider-session authority. Review
  certification shall use the terminal action's daemon-derived route and
  artifact lineage rather than caller-supplied reviewer-family relation.
- **FR-017 (Stage 1):** The daemon shall resume committed coordination state after an
  unclean restart.
- **FR-018 (Stage 1):** Before barrier closure, the fabric shall export a
  schema-valid `fabric-receipt.json`; the chair shall declare it as the
  `fabric-coordination-receipt` evidence artifact in the canonical
  `delivery-run` receipt before the run is accepted.
- **FR-019 (Stage 5):** The fabric shall support bounded leaders and registered
  worker subtrees subject to depth, authority and budget limits.

### 22.2 Quality requirements

- **NFR-001 (Stage 1, security):** No remote listener shall be active by default.
- **NFR-002 (Stage 1, security):** Socket, state and discovery files shall reject access by
  other local users.
- **NFR-003 (Stage 1, reliability):** A crash after message commit and before delivery
  shall result in replay, not message loss.
- **NFR-004 (Stage 3, reliability):** Retried fabric commands shall map to one
  durable action record. An ambiguous side-effecting provider command shall not
  be replayed automatically unless downstream idempotency is proven for the
  same canonical adapter/action pair.
- **NFR-005 (Stage 1, performance):** Local coordination operations shall meet the p95
  target in section 20.
- **NFR-006 (Stage 1, maintainability):** A new fake adapter shall pass the
  published adapter conformance suite without modifying task, lease or mailbox
  core logic; real adapters add only compatibility data and adapter-local code.
- **NFR-007 (Stage 2, portability):** Claude and Codex clients shall use the same protocol
  and schemas without harness-specific forks.
- **NFR-008 (Stage 3, auditability):** Every fabric-mediated intervention and
  every intervention reported by an integration shall appear in the fabric
  receipt. Interactive profiles shall declare direct-input provenance as
  `complete`, `partial` or `unavailable`.
- **NFR-009 (Stage 3, usability):** The operator shall be able to select a named
  execution profile without editing provider adapter code.
- **NFR-010 (Stage 1, recoverability):** Restart tests shall recover the last
  committed mailbox watermark and out-of-order acknowledgements, task revision
  and lease generation.

## 23. Acceptance scenarios

### AC-001 (Stage 3): symmetric paired messaging

Given Claude Code is chair and a persistent Codex peer is attached
When Claude sends a task message and Codex replies
Then both messages, acknowledgements, revisions and artifact hashes are visible
through the same fabric interface
And the scenario also passes with Codex and Claude roles reversed.

### AC-002 (Stage 3): observed paired programming

Given the `paired-observed` profile
And the human launched or attached the chair session inside Herdr
When a Claude/Codex pair begins work
Then Herdr places both primary sessions side-by-side
And their task, lifecycle and unread-message state is visible
And closing the non-chair observed pane stops only its renderer
And recreating that renderer resumes its display cursor without acknowledging
mailbox messages or creating another provider session
And closing or losing the chair TUI follows the interactive-session-loss
behaviour in section 17.

### AC-003 (Stage 3): interactive delivery limitation

Given an interactive TUI is busy in a provider turn
When another agent sends it a structured message
Then the message is durably queued
And no delivery acknowledgement is recorded until the TUI drains and consumes
the message
And a Herdr wake-up alone does not satisfy delivery.

### AC-003A (Stage 3): interactive paired round trip

Given both paired primaries use `cooperative-pull` or a stronger mode
When the chair queues a message while the peer is idle
Then unread state is surfaced in its Herdr pane
And the peer explicitly consumes and acknowledges the exact message ID at its
next safe turn
And its reply is persisted and acknowledged through the same fabric API
And a missed deadline remains `delivery-pending`, not delivered.

### AC-004 (Stage 5): bounded hierarchy

Given a chair delegates a budget and source scope to a leader
When the leader creates worker tasks
Then each child grant is contained by the leader's grant
And an over-depth, over-budget or wider-path grant is rejected.

### AC-005 (Stage 1): fenced ownership recovery

Given a task owner or writer loses its session while holding a task lease
When the chair reassigns the task after checkpoint or expiry
Then the replacement receives a higher lease generation
And the successor cannot start until predecessor revocation, operating-system
isolation or patch-only serial application is proven
And otherwise the scope becomes `quarantined`.

### AC-006 (Stage 1): daemon restart

Given messages, tasks and provider resume references are committed
When the daemon is terminated without graceful shutdown and restarted
Then it restores the last committed state
And redelivers unacknowledged messages without duplicating acknowledged actions.

### AC-007 (Stage 3): visibility degradation

Given observed workers are running and Herdr telemetry or a renderer becomes
unavailable
When the provider runtimes remain healthy
Then work may continue under policy
And the run records `visibility-degraded`
And no task or message is inferred from missing pane telemetry
And loss of an interactive TUI is instead reconciled as provider-session loss.

### AC-008 (Stage 3): safe completion

Given an agent reports completion-ready
When it still owns a write lease or has an in-flight child
Then release is refused
And it is released only after checkpoint, child reconciliation, barrier closure
and lease release.

### AC-009 (Stage 3): unannounced compaction

Given an interactive provider compacts without a valid fabric checkpoint
When the fabric detects a new provider-session generation or context revision
Then it atomically records one typed generation-loss predecessor with the exact
old/new session, generation, bridge, capability, checkpoint and source rows
And the agent becomes `context-unreconciled`, its writes/turns/claims/barriers
are fenced, and no missing custody is inferred
And `agent-lifecycle-recovery` accepts that exact generation-loss arm or an
exact custody arm, never a bare null predecessor
And only fresh rotation through a verified checkpoint or confirmed abandonment
can close the loss; generic Resume and chair-loss recovery cannot.

### AC-010 (Stage 1): untrusted project configuration

Given project configuration attempts to replace an adapter command, add an
environment source or widen a workspace root
When configuration is validated
Then validation fails before daemon or adapter startup
And no project field selects executable code or credentials.

### AC-011 (Stage 3): ambiguous provider action

Given an adapter terminates after provider acceptance but before terminal-result
commit
When the daemon recovers
Then it reconciles the stable action ID
And either records the single provider action or quarantines the ambiguity
And it never automatically creates a second side-effecting action.

### AC-012 (Stage 2): shared daemon and symmetric proxies

Given two independently started MCP proxy processes identify as Claude and
Codex clients
When each connects through the per-user socket and calls the same tool and
resource schemas
Then both observe one run, task revision and mailbox store
And no harness-specific fork changes the protocol or resource result.

### AC-013 (Stage 4): optional adapter degradation

Given an enabled optional-family adapter passes conformance but its provider is
unavailable
When its configured retry and acknowledgement deadline expires
Then the optional leg becomes degraded or failed with the reason recorded
And the required Claude/Codex path remains unblocked
And no side-effecting action is replayed without reconciliation.

### AC-071 (Stage 4): task-bound ephemeral provider review

Given the chair owns or participates in one active review task and delegates a
read-only externally disclosable authority envelope
When it dispatches `operation: spawn` as the current target chair to an
activated certifying-review-packet-only.v1 adapter with an exact current
target/slot/head, structural
route request, resolved profile, complete bundle/coverage and exact task ID
Then Fabric persists one action and promptly returns its immutable accepted
`prepared` or `dispatched` dispatch receipt; provider completion never changes
that receipt
And the action's immutable route binding contains the canonical daemon-produced
route receipt and digest before provider I/O
And one daemon-owned completion settles it while the chair reads the same
action through `provider-action.read` rather than redispatching
And a safe or UNUSABLE terminal result automatically creates immutable evidence
and CAS-advances the reserved slot head before that terminal read is visible;
optional `review-evidence.annotate` cannot change certification
And exact replay returns that same route and action, while a missing task,
stale task scope, forbidden disclosure, route/payload mismatch, changed route
request, duplicate changed action or unsupported adapter fails before provider
work
And Fabric derives the safe result, model identity, open findings and one
reviewer-family-versus-target-chair relation from the exact terminal action,
target/head/bundle, route, task, result/answer digests and reviewed artifact
And no retained agent identity, capability or hidden direct-CLI result path is
created.

## 24. Verification strategy

### Static and schema checks

- Parse every YAML configuration example and JSON Schema.
- Validate MCP tool input and output schemas.
- Validate authority subset and path canonicalisation rules.
- Validate `adapter-compatibility.yaml` and reject untrusted configuration that
  selects executable code, credentials or listeners.
- Extend `scripts/check-harness` with fabric protocol and documentation checks.

### Unit tests

- mailbox ordering, cursors, acknowledgement and deduplication;
- task dependency transitions and compare-and-set revisions;
- lease acquisition, renewal, expiry, transfer and stale-generation rejection;
- authority and budget narrowing;
- path overlap, traversal and symlink escape;
- lifecycle checkpoint completeness;
- visibility profile resolution.

### Integration tests

- two simulated MCP clients exchange messages through one daemon;
- daemon crash and restart during message delivery;
- adapter crash without core crash;
- crash injection before dispatch, after provider acceptance and before
  terminal-result commit for every mutating adapter operation;
- one active turn per provider session;
- Herdr telemetry loss, observed-renderer loss and interactive TUI loss as
  distinct cases;
- observed renderer restart and interactive round-trip behaviour;
- Claude-chair/Codex-peer and Codex-chair/Claude-peer smoke tests.

### Evaluation scenarios

Because orchestration is judgement-bearing, deterministic tests are necessary
but insufficient. A repeatable evaluation set shall cover:

- leader over-delegation attempts;
- cross-team confused-deputy messages;
- two agents requesting the same write surface;
- an interactive operator changing the task mid-turn;
- provider outage and optional-family degradation;
- compaction requested before checkpoint;
- a council disagreement incorrectly treated as a vote;
- an agent attempting to clear itself while owning work;
- excessive fan-out and message storms;
- reviewer-family relation after shared authorship.

## 25. Delivery stages

### Stage 0: approve the design

- Cross-family and independent review of this specification.
- Resolve blocking findings and record disagreements.
- Human accepts, rejects or amends this specification.

### Stage 1: protocol and mailbox slice

- Versioned schemas, file-compatible event export and fake adapters.
- SQLite core, migrations and command-line inspection tools.
- No provider credentials or real provider sessions.

### Stage 2: shared MCP facade

- Two MCP proxies connect to one daemon.
- Symmetric Claude/Codex mailbox, artifact and task operations through the
  Stage 2 subset in section 14.
- Resource round-trip tests from both clients, with the documented read-only
  tool fallback if required.
- No automatic registration without a separate human gate.

### Stage 3: persistent primary pair

- Codex app-server and Claude Agent SDK adapters.
- Headless managed and observed managed profiles.
- Capability-gated interactive inbox delivery and Herdr wake-ups.
- This is the first operational release boundary.

### Stage 4: provider expansion

- Pi as the first generic worker adapter.
- Agy, Cursor Composer/Grok and Kiro or ACP adapters behind the same contract.
- Fresh optional-family work uses the current task-bound ephemeral provider
  action; retained child agents continue to require a generation-bound bridge.

### Stage 5: teams and hardening

- Shallow leader teams, budget inheritance and subtree recovery.
- Security, load, migration and judgement-bearing evaluation suites.
- Review whether evidence justifies deeper hierarchy or Pi as another chair.

The direct implementation instruction on 10 July 2026 names Stages 1–5. Each
stage still requires deterministic verification and independent review before
the next stage is treated as conformant. External configuration and runtime
activation remain separately gated.

## 26. Decision record and alternatives

Decision status: **Accepted on 10 July 2026**. The human maintainer owns final
implementation acceptance.

The proposed decision is to implement one harness-neutral local agent-fabric
daemon in `~/.agents`. Claude Code and Codex use the same MCP facade. Provider
adapters manage worker sessions. Herdr provides optional observation,
interaction and wake-ups without owning durable messages, authority or project
artifacts. Pi is an optional generic worker runtime rather than the initial
chair.

Consequences:

- either primary can chair through the same protocol;
- visible paired programming remains available;
- provider runtimes and model routing remain replaceable;
- the daemon becomes load-bearing local software with security, migration and
  crash-recovery obligations;
- interactive sessions have explicitly weaker delivery and auditability than
  fabric-managed sessions;
- project artifacts remain outside the coordination database.

### Standalone daemon versus provider plugin

The daemon adds operational weight but avoids giving one harness ownership of
shared state. Thin plugins remain useful for discovery, hooks and commands.

### SQLite versus files only

SQLite provides transactions and concurrent cursors. Append-only exports keep
coordination inspectable and provide a degraded recovery format. Project
artifacts do not move into the database.

### Observed sessions versus interactive TUIs

Observed sessions provide reliable structured control and almost the same
visibility. Interactive TUIs permit direct human intervention but cannot offer
guaranteed mid-turn delivery. Both are supported because paired programming may
value human visibility more than minimum overhead.

### Shallow versus arbitrary hierarchy

The recursive schema keeps future options open. A shallow initial limit avoids
telephone loss, cost growth and unclear ownership before real runs demonstrate
the need for deeper management layers.

### Pi worker versus Pi chair

Pi reduces adapter overhead for model-neutral workers. It does not remove the
need for shared authority, mailboxes and receipts, so it remains below the
fabric until operating evidence supports a chair role.

## 27. Known risks

- Provider protocols, particularly experimental app-server surfaces, may drift.
- The daemon is a new single point of local coordination failure.
- Interactive operator input cannot always be distinguished from provider or
  hook output.
- Flat-rate subscription automation may have economic or terms-of-service
  constraints that differ by provider.
- A coordination lease cannot stop a full-access process from writing outside
  scope; runtime isolation remains necessary.
- Deep teams can spend more context on reporting than execution.
- A central coordination database can become a second source of truth if
  project artifacts are allowed to migrate into it.

## 28. Review questions

Reviewers shall answer with evidence and proposed text changes:

1. Does the observed/interactive/hybrid model preserve both reliable
   orchestration and the requested side-by-side experience?
2. Are authority, ownership and direct messaging sufficiently separated?
3. Can the system recover without silently duplicating side effects?
4. Does any record wrongly compete with project-owned artifacts or provider
   session stores?
5. Are the adapter boundary and capability negotiation flexible enough for Agy,
   Cursor Composer/Grok, Kiro/ACP and future providers?
6. Are lifecycle and compaction responsibilities implementable across Claude,
   Codex and Pi?
7. Which requirements or acceptance scenarios are not objectively testable?
8. Is any first-release surface unnecessarily broad?
