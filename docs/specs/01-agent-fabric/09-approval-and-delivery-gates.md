## 30. Approval gate

The specification and Stages 1–5 were authorised by direct human instruction
on 10 July 2026 after the recorded Fable and independent reviews. Final human
acceptance remains mandatory after deterministic verification, evaluation and
independent implementation review. Installation, MCP registration, provider
login, daemon activation, deployment, release and Git publication remain
separate actions.

## 31. Implementation clarifications

These choices refine existing requirements without widening scope:

- Authority paths are canonical workspace-relative prefixes. Empty paths,
  absolute paths, traversal, glob syntax and unresolved symlink escapes are
  rejected. Denies dominate allows. Actions use the versioned fabric operation
  vocabulary; disclosure narrows from `allowed` to `scoped` to `forbidden`.
- Write scopes use the same canonical prefix records. Intersection means equal
  prefixes or one prefix containing the other. Non-existent targets are
  resolved through their nearest existing ancestor before admission.
- Budget dimensions carry a `unit_key`. Currency is `cost:<ISO-4217>` and
  provider-sensitive tokens use `input_tokens:<provider-family>` or
  `output_tokens:<provider-family>`. Unlike units never aggregate.
- Principal generation fences capability rotation. Individual mutations also
  name every required resource lease and expected generation; there is no
  ambiguous principal-wide current lease.
- A ready task has one proposed owner but no owner lease. Claim atomically
  verifies dependencies, advances the task to active and issues its owner
  lease. Complete, cancelled and explicitly degraded dependencies satisfy
  readiness; blocked dependencies do not.
- Task participants are its owner plus explicitly registered participants.
  Direct communication is allowed for a shared task, either direction of a
  direct dependency edge, or a shared discussion group. These records grant no
  work authority.
- The daemon owns the canonical adapter-action journal. Each adapter also keeps
  reconciliation evidence behind its process boundary. The daemon imports that
  evidence only through `lookup_action`.
- `fabric_team_create` accepts the leader, root task, initial registered
  members, discussion groups and reserved budget atomically. Existing agent and
  task operations manage later assignment. Subtree freeze and adoption remain
  chair-only lifecycle commands rather than separate public team tools.
- Deterministic Stage 3 acceptance uses contract fixtures and fake provider
  processes. Live Claude, Codex and Herdr smoke tests are opt-in because they
  require authentication and may consume provider quotas; a live smoke result
  is operational evidence, not a unit-test prerequisite.
- Performance evidence records host, Node version, database mode, agent count,
  operation mix, warm-up and sample count. The 100 ms p95 gate uses at least 32
  simulated agents and 1,000 measured local operations after warm-up.
- If an interactive provider cannot report compaction or context revision, the
  receipt declares detection unavailable. Such a session cannot claim complete
  direct-input provenance and requires explicit owner reconciliation before a
  barrier closes.
