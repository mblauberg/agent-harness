# GitHub work-item workflow

Use this process for user- and agent-originated repository work. Project
Status is the sole workflow state; labels describe content or gates, not
progress.

## Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Backlog | Untriaged or explicitly deferred. |
| Ready | Accepted with bounded scope, authority and acceptance evidence. |
| In progress | An owner is executing the accepted work. |
| In review | The pull request, checks or independent review is active. |
| Awaiting user | Machine work is ready but a user decision or acceptance remains. |
| Done | The item is integrated, or closed with its terminal reason recorded. |

## Triage

1. Check the evidence, desired outcome, scope, acceptance evidence,
   dependencies, risk, authority and user gates.
2. Record one result in a comment:
   - **Accepted:** state the bounded scope, authority and remaining gates; set
     `Ready`.
   - **Rejected:** give an evidence-based reason and a condition that would
     justify reopening; set `Done` and close as not planned.
   - **Deferred:** give the reason and reconsideration condition; leave open in
     `Backlog`.
   - **Duplicate:** link the canonical item; set `Done` and close as not planned.
3. Agents may triage only inside their granted authority. A spec, one-way-door
   choice, final acceptance or release decision moves to `Awaiting user`; an
   agent never infers it. User-originated items follow the same evidence and
   scope checks.

## Execute and review

1. Set `In progress` when an owner starts the accepted scope.
2. Link a pull request with `Closes #N` only when merge leaves no user or
   external-action gate. Otherwise use `References #N` and keep the issue open.
3. Set `In review` while exact-head checks and independent review run. A new
   commit invalidates that exact-head evidence and it must be rerun.
4. If machine gates pass but a user gate remains, set `Awaiting user`.
5. A user decision comment names the selected choice, artifact or exact head,
   supporting evidence and every remaining gate.
6. Set `Done` only after the issue has no remaining gate and its terminal
   reason or integrated pull request is recorded.

Use a text or Mermaid diagram only when several actors, dependencies or state
transitions would otherwise be difficult to review. Simple issues and pull
requests do not need one.
