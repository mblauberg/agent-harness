# ADR 0008 — Risk/oracle-adjusted certifying review

**Status:** Accepted 2026-07-13 (human, scoping round 7); unimplemented
review-policy follow-ups superseded 2026-07-15 (human, [issue
#97](https://github.com/mblauberg/provenant/issues/97)); implementation
identifiers amended to descriptive owners 2026-07-16 ([issue
#135](https://github.com/mblauberg/provenant/issues/135)).

## Context

`HARNESS.md` currently requires fresh native and other-primary review for
substantial work, then additional bonus-family attempts for crucial and
terminal work. Earlier implementation identifiers inherited a milestone
codename and obscured their durable owners.

## Decision

Certifying review pressure follows the current `HARNESS.md` risk table.
Exceptions and degradations are recorded explicitly. Deterministic oracles stay
primary; findings block on evidence, never votes.

Companion round-7 adoptions: decision packets in `/scope` for broad work
(one-question-at-a-time retained for dependent choices);
the unimplemented review amendment and `architecture-review` skill proposal
are superseded. No replacement skill or specification is created.

Style policy: terse output stays default for inter-agent/mechanical/status
traffic; human-facing explanatory output is domain-appropriate. The `caveman`
overlay loads only on explicit request, avoiding a duplicate skill load.

Current implementation identifiers name their owners directly: certifying
review owns the four-slot profile, Console acceptance owns the requirement and
evidence catalogues, Agent Fabric owns its system tests, and lifecycle-skill
alignment owns its focused fixtures and deterministic portability evaluation.
The cutover is direct; no old-name aliases or compatibility path exists.

## Consequences

- The current `HARNESS.md` risk-based, cross-family routing remains governing.
  Deterministic oracles remain primary.
- No `architecture-review` skill or replacement framework is created. The
  milestone-derived identifiers are retired without compatibility aliases.
- Reviewer yield/cost tracking informs later calibration.
