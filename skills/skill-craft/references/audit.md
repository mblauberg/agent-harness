# Audit branch

Read-only assessment of an existing Agent Skill: triggers, overlap,
portability, token cost, security and effectiveness evidence. This branch is
read-only: report evidence, never edit skills. Shared doctrine (four
pillars, budgets, fixture taxonomy, failure vocabulary, provenance) lives in
[../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md); this file carries only what audit does that
authoring does not.

When a request combines audit with revision, evaluation, export or
documentation, the action-owning lifecycle remains primary and this branch is
its companion.

## Evidence modes

Default to static analysis and frozen routing fixtures. Do not inspect session
history, private memory or project content merely because it exists.

For personal work, a direct user request authorises read-only analysis of the
named local histories. Do not require a second privacy receipt,
redaction pass, retention date or minimum-cell suppression. Read histories in
place; keep temporary excerpts local and run-owned; never commit raw transcripts
or promote them to project truth. Ask only when roots or the useful time window
are materially ambiguous. Unsupported or unattributable evidence is `N/A`,
never zero.

An aggregate or paraphrased report to the user in the same authorised
session is local delivery, not sharing/export, and needs no second
disclosure confirmation. Run-owned scratch is allowed. Separate
authority is required before creating a persistent repository/shared artifact,
sending raw excerpts to another provider, or disclosing to a new audience or
external destination. When authorised, confirm with the user the audience,
destination and whether excerpts are allowed; exclude secrets and out-of-scope
third-party content.

## Workflow

1. Resolve target skills from the canonical catalogue and deduplicate links.
2. Check frontmatter/YAML, trigger and exclusion clarity,
   adjacent-skill conflicts, broken paths/tools, instruction density, body size,
   progressive disclosure, complete provider-rendered catalogue budget,
   provider-sidecar parity, provenance/licence, authority/state writes, scripts,
   hooks/MCP/network surfaces and deterministic fixtures.
3. If local history analysis was requested, classify provenance before
   calculating signals: user, platform metadata, notification, managed worker,
   skill injection, command or unknown. Never infer selection from a skill
   merely being loaded, and state small-sample limitations.
4. When mining human corrections, cluster corrections by meaning and classify
   each cluster as an existing-rule miss, trigger miss, weak steering, missing
   procedure or gate, or local preference. Trigger misses, weak steering and
   missing procedures may justify skill text; existing-rule misses belong in
   fixtures or execution checks, and local preferences remain local. Literal
   search can confirm known residue; it cannot establish semantic coverage.
5. Use balanced, frozen routing evals for undertrigger and overtrigger
   claims. A raw keyword match is only a candidate, not ground truth.
6. Report all dimensions from [method.md](method.md); mark missing evidence
   `N/A` and keep static facts separate from behavioural estimates.

For a plugin/package intake, pin source and commit, inventory every component
and digest, inspect manifests, installers, hooks, binaries, MCP/app endpoints,
network/data retention, permissions, update/rollback and licence boundaries.
Do not execute third-party code during static intake. Recommend a plugin only
for a coherent distribution/runtime boundary; otherwise extract small licensed
mechanisms into existing local owners.

## Output

Return a compact table with score, evidence and confidence, then P0/P1/P2
findings. Every behavioural rate names its numerator, denominator, source,
window and limitations. Suggested description changes must name the confusion
case and a balanced regression fixture — build it with
[author.md](author.md)'s fixture step. Prefer tiering detail into references;
merge or split only when triggers, authority, artifacts and completion gates
support a stable boundary (`MAINTAINING.md`).

Do not cross into authoring from here — [../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md)'s
audit → edit rule governs; a fix needs its own authority grant.
