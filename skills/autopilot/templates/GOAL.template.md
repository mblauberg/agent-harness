  HUMAN-OWNED FILE. The conductor reads this at the START of every iteration
  and obeys it. The conductor must NEVER author content into this file — it
  is the one place the human steers and stops the mission. The ONLY clean
  exit is a human setting STATUS: STOP below.

  This template is domain-agnostic. Every domain fact lives in the CONFIG
  KNOBS block — fill it ONCE, then run scripts/bootstrap-autopilot.sh to

## Mission (open-ended — run until STOP)

{{MISSION}}

The framing is **never declare "done" without human STOP.** An empty queue
triggers one bounded re-enumeration pass. If the frontier remains dry, the
conductor writes an idle checkpoint and pauses dispatch until a material
resume trigger. That pause is resumable; only `STATUS: STOP` in this file
closes the mission.

## Traversal order (default — "Active directives" below override it)

1. **Foundational one-way-doors first.** Drive the highest-blast-radius,
   hardest-to-reverse decisions early via `orchestrate` waves rather than a
   single-agent pick. Flag the `{{ESCALATION_GATES}}` ones and design AROUND
   them — never stall the whole mission on a gated item.
2. **Descend the dependency tiers**, respecting `depends-on` in `QUEUE.md`;
   run INDEPENDENT units concurrently within the `{{RUNAWAY_CAPS}}` caps.
3. As work settles, **build/decide** up to `{{BUILD_CEILING}}` by delegating
   to `implement`/`deliver`, whose receipts land in this mission directory.
4. **When the queue empties, re-enumerate once.** If no real work appears,
   persist an idle checkpoint and pause; never invent depth merely to stay
   busy.

## Locked constraints (do NOT relitigate)

{{LOCKED_CONSTRAINTS}}

> Design around these; do not reopen them. They are settled inputs, not
> decisions.

## Escalation-gated items (design around — do not stall the mission)

{{ESCALATION_GATES}}

> Each of these is owned by a human, an expert authority, a judge panel, a
> spike, an apply-time act, or a promotion review — not by the conductor.
> Build to the intent, keep the flagged optionality, record the open
> question, mark the gate in `STATE.md` "Blockers", and proceed on
> everything else.

## Active directives (human-editable steering)

> Add bullets here to focus the mission on something specific. Empty =
> follow the traversal order above. This block overrides the default
> traversal.



## STATUS gate

To stop: change `STATUS:` below to `STOP` (and interrupt the loop if
running). The conductor checks this **every iteration** and writes a clean
handoff in `STATE.md` + refreshes `HANDOFF.md` before halting.

> **Flipping to STOP is a finish-blocker unless GOAL + STATE + HANDOFF all
> agree on the terminal truth.** A STOP written while the capstone is stale
> is a bug. When you flip it, write an inline audit note (who / why / when)
> and update PREV.

STATUS: RUN
<!-- audit note: who/why/when this last flipped. RUN at scaffold. -->
PREV: (none)
